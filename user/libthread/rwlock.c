/** @file rwlock.c
 *  @brief Contains the implementation of rwlock
 *
 *  rwlock_t contains the following fields
 *     1. lock_state: it is used to indicate the state of rwlock. 
 *        lock_state == 0 means rwlock is available (unlocked).
 *        lock_state > 0 means some readers are holding the lock (shared), the 
 *                       value of lock_state indicates how many readers are 
 *                       holding the lock
 *        lock_state == -1 means a writer is holding the lock (exclusvie)
 *        lock_state == -2 means the rwlock is destoried
 *     2. writer_waiting_count: indicates how many writers are waiting the lock
 *     3. reader_waiting_count: indicates how many readers are waiting the lock
 *     4. mutex_inner: a mutex to protect critical section of rwlock code.
 *     5. cond_reader: conditional variable for readers to block
 *     6. cond_writer: conditional variable for writers to block
 *
