/** @brief Creates a new thread to run func(args) on a given stack
 *  
 *  This function is writtrn in assembly. It will create a thread 
 *  (a register set) to run func(args) on a given stack.
 *
 *  To be more specific, this function will first save its two parameters to
 *  registers. Then it will invoke thread_fork which is a trap. After that, two
 *  threads will run the same code. The original thread will just return. The 
 *  new thread will first get its ktid, and call arraytcb_set_ktid() to save its
 *  ktid in arraytcb. Then it will set its esp to new_stack, and call func(). 
 *  After return from func(), it will push the return value to stack, and call
 *  thr_exit() if the thread doesn't call itself.
 *
 *  Note that the two paramters (func, new_stack) must be saved in registers
 *  before calling thread_fork. Because at first they are saved at the original
 *  thread's stack. After thread_fork, the new thread can't rely on the original 
 *  threads's stack to fetch these two paramters. Because at that time, the 
 *  stack maybe destroied by the original thread. 
 *  
 *
 *  @param func The address of function for new thread to run
 *  @param new_stack The address of new stack (esp) for new thread to run on.
 *                   Note that the argument for new thread to run func(args) has 
 *                   been pushed to stack conforming to the calling conventions.
 * 
 *  @return On success the thread ID of the new thread is returned, on error a 
 *          negative number is returned

/** @brief Delete a thread from arraytcb and vanish
 *  
 *  This function is called by thr_exit() to delete a thread from arraytcb,
 *  deallocate its stack memory and call vanish(). The code is written in 
 *  assembly, but it equals to exceute the following code:
 *      if (page_remove_info[1])
 *          remove_pages(page_remove_info[0]);
 *      if (page_remove_info[3])
 *          remove_pages(page_remove_info[2]);
 *      if (page_remove_info[5])
 *          remove_pages(page_remove_info[4]);
 *      SPINLOCK_UNLOCK(&mutex_arraytcb->inner_lock);
 *      vanish();
 *  However, it must be written in assembly because when stack region is
 *  deallocated, the program can not rely on stack to call new functions 
 *  (i.e. the following remove_pages(), SPINLOCK_UNLOCK() and vanish()). So 
 *  asm_thr_exit() will just use some registers to execute all code abve.    
 *
 *  @param inner_lock It is the addres of mutex_arraytcb->inner_lock. it is 
 *                 used to execute SPINLOCK_UNLOCK(&mutex_arraytcb->inner_lock);
 *  @param page_remove_info Address of the array page_remove_info. It is used to
 *                          indicate which pages should be deallcated. More info
 *                          please refer to thr_lib_helper.c 
 *                          get_pages_to_remove().
 * 
 *  @return Should never return
